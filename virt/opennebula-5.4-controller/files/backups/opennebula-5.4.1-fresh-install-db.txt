This opennebula-5.4.1-fresh-install-db file is a dump right after opennebula was installed.
A fresh install using ansible exactly as described in the documentation
I did however, visit sunstone and login as oneadmin just once.  I did nothing in the GUI, just logged in.
Perhaps login identifies an empty db and stubs it out.  Or it was stubbed upon initial installation

If resetting opennebula to fresh install is as simple as a fresh created db, then this file is it.
But I am not sure if that is all it takes.  Could have stuff elsewhere.  To reset, you can also use the root
LVM snapshot created on the controller node, then re-run ansible!
